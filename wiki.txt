 Intersections

  Array storing all known intersections, which are just points as
  opposed tofinding them everytime they click the screen.

  When a shape is drawn, do you just iterate through all of our shapes
  and check for intersection points, and then add them to the points.



  Issues:
    Math
      Point overlapping is weird, because we click on a 5px raidus, so
      we can click on more than 1 point at once... at the moment, the
      first in the point array will register as clicked

      There could also be some potential round errors to deal with.
