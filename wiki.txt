  Level
    Level loader
    Goal 
    Starting shapes (would be nice to have a specific layer for this but
     not necessary)

  Drawer
    Handles layer management and drawing

  Intersections
    Don't draw until chosen


  Issues
    Layers
      Look into how intersections get context

    Math Issues
      Point overlapping is weird, because we click on a 5px raidus, so
      we can click on more than 1 point at once... at the moment, the
      first in the point array will register as clicked

      There could also be some potential round errors to deal with.
