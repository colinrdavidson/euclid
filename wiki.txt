  IMMEDIATE BUGS
    Circle isSame function borked. 
      -need to check focus and rad, not focus and locus.
    Some lines don't intersect with some lines.
      -likely a rounding error, need to decide on an accuracy

    Goal (intersections)
    Starting shapes (would be nice to have a specific layer for this but
     not necessary)
  Drawer
    Handles layer management and drawing

 Intersections

  Array storing all known intersections, which are just points as
  opposed tofinding them everytime they click the screen.

  When a shape is drawn, do you just iterate through all of our shapes
  and check for intersection points, and then add them to the points.



  Issues:
    Math
      Point overlapping is weird, because we click on a 5px raidus, so
      we can click on more than 1 point at once... at the moment, the
      first in the point array will register as clicked

      There could also be some potential round errors to deal with.
